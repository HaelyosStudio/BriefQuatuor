# Create a backend API & SPA for frontend

This team project aims to create an SPA that consumes an API. To do this, there were 3 of us including HaelyosStudio for the front end and Vellanos as well as M0orph3us for the backend.
We had to create an interface to allow students to sign their class attendance, with administrators who could modify any element.

We had 4 days of 8 hours to complete it.
